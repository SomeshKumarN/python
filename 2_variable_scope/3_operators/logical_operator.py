#Logical Operators
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.
# In Python, there are three logical operators: and, or, and not.
#1. Logical AND Operator ( Multiplication )
    #1 X 1 = 1
    #1 X 0 = 0
    #0 X 1 = 0
    #0 X 0 = 0
#2. Logical OR Operator ( Addition )
    #1 + 1 = 1
    #1 + 0 = 1
    #0 + 1 = 1
    #0 + 0 = 0
#3. Logical NOT Operator ( Negation )
    #0 = 1
    #1 = 0

# 1. Logical AND Operator
number = 25

isNumberField = False  # Check if number is an integer
isLessThan20 = number < 20
isGreaterThan10 = number > 10
isValidNumber = isNumberField and isLessThan20 and isGreaterThan10

def printValidNumber(isValid):
    if isValid:
        print("The number is valid")
    else:
        print("The number is not valid")

printValidNumber(isValidNumber)

# 2. Logical OR Operator
number = 25

isNumberField = False  # Check if number is an integer
isLessThan20 = number < 20
isGreaterThan10 = number > 10
isValidNumber = isNumberField or isLessThan20 or isGreaterThan10

printValidNumber(isValidNumber)

# 3. Logical NOT Operator
mark = 50
engineStarted = False

if (engineStarted):
    print("Engine is running")
    
if (not engineStarted):
    print("Start the Engine")
